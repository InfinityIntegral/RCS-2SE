Unit 3.6 - this pointer and instance functions
I have a pointer to myself

this pointer
Every instance member function provides access to a pointer called this, which points to the instance.
In addition to allowing you to pass the instance as argument into other functions, it also lets you reuse variable names, which are very helpful in constructors.

Example
Vector2::Vector2(float xVal, float yVal){	x = xVal;	y = yVal;}
Instead of using new variable names xVal and yVal, we can name them x and y also. Then, when referring to the member instance properties, we use (*this).x and (*this).y

Example
Vector2::Vector2(float x, float y){	(*this).x = x;	(*this).y = y;}
much neater
