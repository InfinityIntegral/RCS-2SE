Unit 4.1 - QDebug
std::cout for Qt

QDebug
QDebug is essentially the std::cout equivalent for Qt.
Instead of printing output into the cmd, QDebug prints output into a dedicated “Application Output” panel in Qt Creator so you can view it more easily.
QDebug also formats your output, such as by inserting quotations, spaces, and newlines as appropriate.

QDebug
Instead of using << into std::cout, you use qDebug(). Remember to include the <QDebug> header first though.
std::cout << 1 << “ ” << 2 << “ ” << 3;qDebug() << 1 << 2 << 3;
These do the same thing, but note how the QDebug version is shorter because no formatting is needed.

use of QDebug in debugging
QDebug is very helpful in debugging.
You can write qDebug() << statements on every line, outputting various values to see what is going wrong.
You can also detect where crashes occur by seeing when QDebug stops printing.
Remember to delete the QDebug statements after debugging.
