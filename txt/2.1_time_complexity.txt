Unit 2.1 - Time Complexity
counting operations, kind of

Counting Operations
A computer can do a few billion operations per second.
That sounds like a lot, but you still cannot use it for some things, for example iterating over all permutations of objects.
You can estimate how long a programme will take to run depending on the input size. This is expressed as a function of the input size.

Counting Operations
Most arithmetic operations - constant O(1)
Loops iterating until n - linear O(n)
Binary search - O(ln n)You will learn about binary search later
Sorting - O(n ln n)
Nesting needs multiplying time complexity
Note: log n or lg n is same as ln n here
