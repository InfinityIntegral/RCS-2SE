Unit 1.7 - Commenting
sometimes your friends are blur

Collaborative programming
For this course, you will be working alone.
However in bigger projects such as Qt or Windows, many people work on the same project. They need to understand each other’s code to work well together.
Comments can help others understand your code more easily.
Imagine you are working at Microsoft to build an upgrade for Windows 11.

No need comments?
bootWindowsSystem(){    lagForSeconds(300.0f);    loadSettings();    displayLoginPage();}
If your code looks like this, you probably do not need comments. You should code like this (not the lag part).

This needs comments
b(){lfs(300.0f); ls(); dlp();}
But if your code looks like this, it is completely unreadable and definitely needs a lot of comments.
You definitely should not be coding like this, but in Informatics Olympiad, there is no time, so we do this to save time.

Single Line Comments
Anything that goes after // is part of a comment.
If you use the 05524F theme (I made it) for Qt Creator, code should display in magenta and comments display in light pink.
someFunction(); // run some function
The compiler ignores comments, they are only for people reading the code.

Multiline Comments
In case you need a long comment, for example to explain the error codes sent by a programme or to explain a design choice, you can use multiline comments.
Multiline comments can span several lines. Their start is marked by /* and their end is marked by */
Similar to single line comments, they should display in light pink if you use the 05524F theme.

Multiline Comments
someFunction();
/*Here we run someFunction.This is very important to how the programme functions.The function repeatedly reminds the user in the cmdthat the user is blur.*/

Much better…
/*A lag of 5 minutes is implemented in Windows 11to show our brand identity.*/b(){ // function to boot Windows    lfs(300.0f); // lag, because we are Microsoft    ls(); // load user settings such as background image    dlp(); // show user the login page}
