Unit 0.3 - Hello, Singapore
because hello world is boring

So we can start coding?
NO!
We first need to set up a IDE.
Pls do not use Notepad for coding, it does not even have undo redo functionality or line wrapping… That is exceptionally blur…

Integrated Development Environments
An IDE is a fancy text editor that you use to write code. It does all the normal text editor stuff including find-replace and undo-redo. It also understands your code and can compile it for you.
Imagine Google Docs, but it is linked to a compiler, and it understands C++. You can even use a custom font such as SingScript.sg

Qt Creator
For this course, we will use Qt Creator. You can get it from https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss, run the installer and in the maintenance tool, select ONLY Qt Creator WITHOUT the Qt libraries.
We will download the Qt libraries later. Also, use the colour configuration (configs/qt_creator_colour.xml) from my GitHub to disable Qt Creator’s broken syntax highlighting.

Qt Creator
To set the syntax highlighting, go toFile > Edit > Preferences > Text Editor > Font & Coloursthen press the “Import…” button and choose the file.
Also go to File > Edit > Preferences > Text Editor > Behaviour > File Encodings > Default line endings and choose “Unix (LF)”

Qt Creator - a warning
Qt Creator crashes often, so save your work frequently by pressing ctrl + S
Qt Creator uses Qt’s complicated compilation process so it will not be able to compile your code automatically. It does have a cmd included, so that is convenient for you to write compilation commands yourself.

Hello, Singapore
With Qt Creator all set up, open a blank text file called test.cpp and copy paste the code below:
#include <iostream>int main(){    std::cout << “Hello, Singapore”;}

Compiling the code
Next, ask the compiler nicely to compile the code.
Hi, g++ compiler interface, → g++can you output a file for me pls? → -oCall that file test.exe, → test.exeand use the source code from test.cpp, → test.cpp
BlurBlur>g++ -o test.exe test.cpp

Running the code
If you copied the code correctly, g++ would have made a new file called test.exe
Now you ask test.exe to run itself. Since it is an executable file (.exe), it knows what to do.
BlurBlur>test.exe
You can see the output appearing in the Qt Creator’s cmd
