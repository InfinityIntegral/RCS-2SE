Unit 0.3 - Hello, Singapore
because hello world is boring

So we can start coding?
NO!
We first need to set up a IDE.
Pls do not use Notepad for coding, it does not even have undo redo functionality or line wrapping… That is exceptionally blur…

Integrated Development Environments
An IDE is a fancy text editor that you use to write code. It does all the normal text editor stuff including find-replace and undo-redo. It also understands your code and can compile it for you.
Imagine Google Docs, but it is linked to a compiler, and it understands C++. You can even use a custom font such as SingScript.sg

Qt Creator - a warning
Qt Creator crashes often, so save your work frequently by pressing ctrl + S
Qt Creator uses Qt’s complicated compilation process so it will not be able to compile your code automatically. It does have a cmd included, so that is convenient for you to write compilation commands yourself.

Hello, Singapore
With Qt all set up, open a blank text file called test.cpp and copy paste the code below:
#include <iostream>int main(){    std::cout << “Hello, Singapore”;}

Compiling the code
Next, ask the compiler nicely to compile the code.
Hi, g++ compiler interface, → g++can you output a file for me pls? → -oCall that file test.exe, → test.exeand use the source code from test.cpp, → test.cpp
BlurBlur>g++ -o test.exe test.cpp

Running the code
If you copied the code correctly, g++ would have made a new file called test.exe
Now you ask test.exe to run itself. Since it is an executable file (.exe), it knows what to do.
BlurBlur>test.exe
You can see the output appearing in the Qt Creator’s cmd
