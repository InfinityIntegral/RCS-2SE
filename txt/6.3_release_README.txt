Unit 6.3 - Release README
not really a README, but still Markdown

Releases
When your software is ready to be used, you should make a release. You can click the “Releases” section at the right side of the repository page and then select “Draft a new release”.
From there, when picking a tag, create a new tag with the semantic version number (something like v1.0.0).

Releases
Notice how the releases page has these 3 things
title
a big textbox
“attach binaries”
The title should be the name of your software with the version number. You can upload a ZIP file of compiled, ready to use code in the “attach binaries” section.

Release README
Inside that big textbox is where you write Markdown code for your release README.
This is technically not called a README, but its functionality is the same as a README and same as READMEs, it uses Markdown.

Release README
A release README generally has an about section and a changelogs section.
Note that in the release README, you do not have the project name with version number, that is in the title.
Also do not write descriptions of the project, that belongs in the project README.

Release README about section
The about section should be a short paragraph describing what changed in this release.
This should give users an idea of how this release differs from the previous one. You can briefly mention added features and fixed bugs.

Release README changelogs
The changelogs should at minimum mention what got added, what got changed, and what got removed.
You can have 3 sub sections, added, changed, and removed.
If you want to give more details, you can do it in the about section or have a longer changelog.
The changelog of the first release should have everything built under “added”.

Writing a release
Using what you learnt, write a release for your Hello, Singapore app.
This will be a source code only release so you will not need to attach any binaries. Building, packaging, and releasing binaries will be taught later.
