Unit 3.10 - The Static Function Class Pattern
no instance members? not a problem

Static Function Class
Very often you have a group of related functions and variables that do not really belong in a class, but you put them all in a class anyways for code organisation.
All these members can then be made static. Since there is no instance members, you never need to create instances.
You can delete the default constructor of the class.

Static Function Class
Static function classes can be used to contain utility functions used during computation, or to contain global app settings.
To delete the constructor:MyStaticFunctionClass() = delete;
